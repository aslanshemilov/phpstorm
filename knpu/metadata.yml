title:  Lean and Mean Dev with PhpStorm (for Symfony) 
summary: |
    Have you ever written out a long `use` statement by hand
    or navigated deep directories to find a file? Then your
    development is about to get *a lot* faster.
    
    PhpStorm makes modern Php development a joy - *especially*
    for Symfony2 users. In this tutorial, we'll use PhpStorm
    to take a lot of the grunt work out of your coding and help
    you get things done faster:
    
    * Get the life-changing Symfony plugin
    * Auto-complete namespaces (please stop typing them)!
    * Tricks for annotations, Doctrine, forms, Twig and more
    * Refactoring
    * Live Templates
    * Fast navigation
    * Symfony service integration
    * .... (and always) well-intentioned jokes.
