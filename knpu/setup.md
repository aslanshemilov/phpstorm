#Setup

Hey guys! If you've watched even one video on KnpU then you've seen me
using PHPStorm. 

Now think about how much you use your editor. If you work 40 hours a 
week then it would be a fair guess that you are looking at your IDE 
20 hours every week, which is about 80 hours a month or 1,000 hours a
year!

So that means that if you can learn something that can save you a few
seconds in this tutorial that can add up to 10's of hours in the future.

Particularly in Symfony development, mastering PHPStorm is going to 
completely speed up the way you develop and help you catch mistakes
you may have otherwise missed.

If you've never used PHPStorm before it does have a free trial period
that you can use to see if it's going to work for you.

I'm working with a fresh version of PHPStorm, this is not how my
development environment looks. So download your copy and we can get
this into working order together.

Let's get this into full screen first. If I open any of my files right 
now you'll see that they look pretty ugly. Let's clean that up first, 
open up preferences and in Appearance under Appearance & Behavior you 
can select your theme, change that to Darcula. This is the theme of the
UI which also goes and sets the scheme for the editor. This is already
so much better. Staring into a white screen for 1,000+ hours a year is
very similar to just staring at a lightbulb -- not so great on the eyes.

Speaking of eyes, I'd like to see my font size a bit bigger here. Back to
preferences, on a mac its shortcut is âŒ˜, so I'll start using that. Use this
search to look for font. This pulls up a few things, general appearance, 
colors & fonts. Let's pick font here and there's font size. 

I can't immediately change the font size I've got because that would change
the Darcula scheme. So first let's click 'save as' so we can customize this,
save it as 'darcula mine'. And now I can change the font size to 14 and give it a
line spacing of 1.2. Ahh so much better.

Over here on the left, you can see the tuts and knpu directory. These are what I
used to help me build this tutorial.
